# Nominate Andela for Crunchies!

The [9th Crunchies Awards](http://techcrunch.com/event-info/9th-annual-crunchies-awards/) by TechCrunch are upon us!

[Andela](http://andela.com) is doing big things in Social Impact and Diversity (training 100,000 African developers and running [all-female bootcamps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6AHDxi449Y))

Therefore, Andela needs you want to nominate them for those categories!

Since you are all really busy with day-to-day life, Crunchies will automatically nominate Andela for those categories everyday for you once installed.

## Installation

###Steps
1. Open the Terminal app on your Mac
2. Install git. [Skip this step if you're a git user]
  * Type `git` in Terminal and press enter. 
  * Click `Install` if a window saying `the git command requires the command line developer tools` pops up.
    * If no window like the above pops up, you most likely have git installed so skip to step 3
  * Wait for git to finish installing
3. Copy and paste `sudo curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andela/crunchies/master/install.sh | bash` into the Terminal window
4. Press enter after pasting
5. Watch the installation magic happen and enter password when prompted


####Notes
1. You will be required to enter your password twice
2. While you enter your password, you will not see the characters as you type (dont worry, this is normal :) )
