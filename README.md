# Nominate Andela for Crunchies!

The [9th Crunchies Awards](http://techcrunch.com/event-info/9th-annual-crunchies-awards/) by TechCrunch are upon us!

[Andela](http://andela.com) is doing big things in Social Impact and Diversity (training 100,000 African developers and running [all-female bootcamps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6AHDxi449Y))

Therefore, Andela needs you want to nominate them for those categories!

Since you are all really busy with day-to-day life, Crunchies will automatically nominate Andela for those categories everyday for you once installed.

## Installation
This installation may take up to 10 minutes if you're new to Terminal and have never used `git`. Nothing to worry about :)

###Steps
1. Open the Terminal app on your Mac
2. Install git. [Skip this step if you're a git user]
  * Type `git` in Terminal and press enter. 
  * Click `Install` if a window saying `the git command requires the command line developer tools` pops up.
    * If no window like the above pops up, you most likely have git installed so skip to step 3
  * Wait for git to finish installing
3. Run the installer
  * Copy and paste `sudo curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andela/crunchies/master/install.sh | bash` into the Terminal window
  * Press Enter
  * Enter your Mac password [While you enter your password, you will not see the characters as you type (dont worry, this is normal :) )]
5. Watch the installation magic happen and enter Mac password when/if prompted
